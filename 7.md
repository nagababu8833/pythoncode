In Kubernetes, usually we create a service of type loadbalancer if we want to expose our application to the internet or use ingress.

But are you aware of the basic difference between Service and Ingress? If no then -

A Service operates at Layer 4 of the OSI model, the transport layer. Meaning it handles basic networking tasks like directing traffic based on the IP address and port. It ensures that requests reach the correct pod by matching IPs, but it doesnâ€™t care about the content of the traffic.

On the other hand, an Ingress works at Layer 7, the application layer. This is where things get more advanced! Ingress allows you to define how HTTP/S traffic should be routed to your services based on the content of the request, such as the URL or host. This means you can use Ingress to implement features like SSL termination, path-based routing, and 
    host-based routing, giving you finer control over how requests are handled.
