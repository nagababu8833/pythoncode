Scenario
You're a DevOps engineer managing a microservices application on a Production Kubernetes cluster. One day, your auth-service, which handles user authentication, starts crashing and experiencing delays. You try looking at logs and metrics but can’t pinpoint the root cause. The issue seems tied to the container's environment and isn’t easy to reproduce.

#Challenge
You tried with standard troubleshooting methods but ran into below challenges 

1. 𝐋𝐢𝐦𝐢𝐭𝐞𝐝 𝐀𝐜𝐜𝐞𝐬𝐬: Using kubectl exec only gives basic visibility into the container. You can't add new tools or make significant changes to diagnose the problem.
2. 𝐓𝐫𝐚𝐧𝐬𝐢𝐞𝐧𝐭 𝐏𝐫𝐨𝐛𝐥𝐞𝐦𝐬: The issue comes and goes, and traditional methods like restarting the pod don’t offer enough insight.
3. 𝐑𝐞𝐬𝐭𝐫𝐢𝐜𝐭𝐞𝐝 𝐄𝐧𝐯𝐢𝐫𝐨𝐧𝐦𝐞𝐧𝐭: Security rules and limited permissions make it tough to perform deeper diagnostics in a production setting.
4. 𝐅𝐢𝐱𝐞𝐝 𝐂𝐨𝐧𝐭𝐚𝐢𝐧𝐞𝐫 𝐒𝐞𝐭𝐮𝐩: You can’t quickly add debugging tools to the existing container without going through the hassle of building and deploying a new image.

#Solution
As a solution you used 𝐤𝐮𝐛𝐞𝐜𝐭𝐥 𝐝𝐞𝐛𝐮𝐠. It provides an effective way to tackle these challenges. Lets see how

1. 𝐌𝐨𝐫𝐞 𝐃𝐞𝐛𝐮𝐠𝐠𝐢𝐧𝐠 𝐎𝐩𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧𝐬: It lets you create a temporary copy of the pod with extra debugging tools, giving you deeper access to troubleshoot.
example :- 𝒌𝒖𝒃𝒆𝒄𝒕𝒍 𝒅𝒆𝒃𝒖𝒈 𝒂𝒖𝒕𝒉-𝒔𝒆𝒓𝒗𝒊𝒄𝒆-𝒑𝒐𝒅 --𝒊𝒎𝒂𝒈𝒆=𝒃𝒖𝒔𝒚𝒃𝒐𝒙 --𝒄𝒐𝒑𝒚-𝒕𝒐=𝒂𝒖𝒕𝒉-𝒔𝒆𝒓𝒗𝒊𝒄𝒆-𝒅𝒆𝒃𝒖𝒈
2. 𝐋𝐢𝐯𝐞 𝐓𝐫𝐨𝐮𝐛𝐥𝐞𝐬𝐡𝐨𝐨𝐭𝐢𝐧𝐠: You can attach to the pod in real time, run diagnostic commands, and investigate without changing the original pod.
example :- 𝐤𝐮𝐛𝐞𝐜𝐭𝐥 𝐝𝐞𝐛𝐮𝐠 𝐚𝐮𝐭𝐡-𝐬𝐞𝐫𝐯𝐢𝐜𝐞-𝐩𝐨𝐝 -𝐢𝐭 --𝐢𝐦𝐚𝐠𝐞=𝐛𝐮𝐬𝐲𝐛𝐨𝐱 --𝐭𝐚𝐫𝐠𝐞𝐭=𝐚𝐮𝐭𝐡-𝐜𝐨𝐧𝐭𝐚𝐢𝐧𝐞𝐫
3. 𝐍𝐨𝐧-𝐃𝐢𝐬𝐫𝐮𝐩𝐭𝐢𝐯𝐞: You don’t need to restart or redeploy the service, keeping production stable while you debug.
4. 𝐂𝐚𝐭𝐜𝐡 𝐈𝐧𝐭𝐞𝐫𝐦𝐢𝐭𝐭𝐞𝐧𝐭 𝐈𝐬𝐬𝐮𝐞𝐬: With kubectl debug, you have a better chance of catching issues as they happen
